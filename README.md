# AI Chatbot using Streamlit and Google Gemini API

This project implements an AI chatbot using Streamlit as the front-end and Googleâ€™s Gemini API for generating responses. The chatbot can interact with users in real-time, answering their queries based on the model's training and capabilities.

## Features

- **Chat History**: The chat history is preserved throughout the session, allowing users to view previous interactions.
- **Clear Chat History**: Users can clear the chat history with a button click.
- **Real-Time Response Generation**: Responses are generated dynamically using Google Gemini's generative model.
